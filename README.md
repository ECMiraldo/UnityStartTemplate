# ðŸš€ Unity Starter Template 

Are you tired of spending all your precious inspiration time on boring setup process and boiler plate code? 
Do you wish you could just open a new Unity project and have a solid foundation to kickstart your new project?

Well, me too! That is why i decided to create this repository, with built-in features that are needed in 99% of all games.
All the custom features that I've coded are all very straight forward and simple to understand, use, modify or delete!
No multi-layered abstractions or over-engineered pasta that would make an Italian nona jealous. 

What you see is what your get!
This a ready-to-use starting template for 2D or 3D games, with a few very helpful QoL third party packages ready to be forked and worked on.
